# Alzheimer's Detection Algorithm
Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other important mental functions. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. The traditional methods of Alzheimer's diagnosis are based on the clinical evaluation of symptoms and patient history. However, these methods can be inaccurate and time-consuming.

To address these challenges, I have developed an Alzheimer's Detection Algorithm using deep learning techniques. The algorithm analyzes MRI scans of patients to detect any abnormalities that indicate the presence of Alzheimer's disease.

# How it Works
The Alzheimer's Detection Algorithm works by first converting MRI scans of patients into digital images. These images are then analyzed using deep learning techniques to detect any abnormalities. The algorithm is designed to learn from a large dataset of MRI scans of patients with and without Alzheimer's disease. It can then use this knowledge to identify the early signs of Alzheimer's disease in new MRI scans.

The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the digital images. The CNN is a type of deep learning neural network that is particularly effective at image recognition tasks. It works by learning features in the images and then using these features to classify the images. Conclusion The Alzheimer's Detection Algorithm is a powerful tool for early detection of Alzheimer's disease. It uses deep learning techniques to analyze MRI scans of patients and detect any abnormalities that may indicate the presence of Alzheimer's disease. The algorithm is highly accurate and can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer's disease in its early stages. With early diagnosis and treatment, patients can receive the care they need to manage the disease and improve their quality of life
